This is about as real as it gets. I want to use this blog as both a journal and a transparent way to share what's next for me.

First, a little background.

I've been working as a Frontend Developer for the past 7 to 8 years in agencies, product teams, and startups. My main stack has always been React and TypeScript, but I also enjoy exploring other languages and frameworks purely for the fun of learning. Golang has been a recent favorite.

For the last five years I've had a strong urge to build something of my own. That could be a business, a side project, or simply something meaningful I can put into the world. The truth is I've struggled with commitment. I've started and stopped many projects. I've had plenty of ideas, but I've never managed to stick with them long enough to see where they could go.

I don't have the perfect solution to this problem, but I do know one thing: I'm ready.

I'm ready to commit to a project.
I'm ready to build something I'm proud of.
I'm ready to create something I'm passionate about.

This blog has been sitting here for a while, and maybe no one will ever find it. That's fine with me. I'm not chasing fame or fortune. What I want is to build something that matters to me and to share that journey with anyone who might find it useful.

## Kvnnt

The first project I am committing to is something I am calling Kvnnt.

Kvnnt comes from my own struggle with consistency and accountability. For years I have wanted to build things, but without a support system it has been too easy to stop when the work gets difficult. Kvnnt is my attempt to fix that problem. Not only for myself, but also for anyone else who knows what it feels like to try and build alone.

At its core, Kvnnt is a small group accountability platform. It is not a massive social network. It is not another noisy community. It is a place for small circles, or "pods," of people who want to set goals, check in each week, and support each other as they make progress. It should feel simple and focused, with just enough structure to help people stay committed without overwhelming them.

The name comes from "covenant." I like the darker, cult-like energy it suggests. Joining a pod inside Kvnnt is not about casually hanging around. It is about showing up with your goals and being part of a group that takes progress seriously. Each week you update your goals, share what you achieved, and see how the rest of your pod is doing.

This may sound dramatic for a simple app, but I think there is real value in treating accountability with weight. I do not just want to build another product. I want to create a space where small groups can actually stick with what they said they would do.

Kvnnt will probably begin small. It might be one pod of friends. It might be a group of solopreneurs in Manchester. It might even start with just me and a few strangers online. That is enough. The goal is not scale. The goal is depth. If it helps even a handful of people, including myself, to keep momentum on their goals, then it will already be worth building.

I don't know exactly where Kvnnt will take me, but this time I am sticking with it. Writing here will be part of that process. Even if nobody else reads these words, they will serve as a record of my progress and keep me accountable to myself.

If you have ever struggled with consistency or found it hard to stay committed to your own projects, maybe you will recognize yourself in this journey. My hope is that Kvnnt can grow into something that helps not just me, but others too. And if at some point you feel like joining a pod and working toward your own goals alongside others, I would love to hear from you.
