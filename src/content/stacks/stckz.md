Hey, I'm Luke and this is my new website stckz.com I'm aiming to post some blog posts about web development and other tech related topics. 
<br />

But first lets talk about the tech stack I'm using to build this site.
<br />
<br />

## The Stack


I chose Astro for this site due to its speed and flexibility. Astro allows you to mix and match different frameworks and libraries to build your site. I'm using TailwindCSS and DaisyUI for the styling and AlpineJS for the interactivity.

<br />

This tech stack allows for insane performance and is really nice DX allowing me to write markdown and have it compiled into a static site, perfect for a blog or a static marketing site.
<br />
<br />

I also wanted to try out using Alpine for the interactivity as I've heard good things about it and it's a lot smaller than Vue or React and I'm really enjoying it so far, it reminds me of old templating languages like Handlebars but with a lot more power.
<br />
<br />

I'm hosting the site on Vercel purely because of how easy it is to deploy and the fact that it's free for small sites like this one. I do have plans to learn a bit more AWS and maybe host it on there in the future but for now Vercel is perfect.
<br />
<br />

I'm really happy with how the site has turned out and I'm looking forward to writing more blog posts in the future. If you have any questions about the tech stack I'm using feel free to reach out to me on Github or Twitter.
<br />
<br />

The lighthouse score for this site is insane.
